I’m a student from Japan studying at some college in the US and I want to learn Deep Learning in depth. It will be beneficial for me to get certified by this course as an aspiring data scientist. But I have currently no space to carry the expanses for the certificate of this course. I have my own family to provide the necessity of everyday life and it becomes a lot difficult for the family members to pay the whole amount for the course. Moreover, my wife and I are both still in school and need to pay our tuition, which makes it even harder for us to afford such amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will definitely help me not only with the certificate but also actually learning about the subject that will hopefully lead to getting a great career in the future. I can say that I’m very in need of this financial aid. Receiving this Financial Aid will open up a new horizon of the world of Coursera courses, which in turn will help me in the future.  I sincerely believe that this course is a need for me and my family as well as for increasing my knowledge about the subject.
