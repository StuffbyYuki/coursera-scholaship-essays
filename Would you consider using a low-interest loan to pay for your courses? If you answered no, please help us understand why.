The financial status of my family is not good at all to pay out the loan. We only have the money to live paycheck to paycheck. My parents stopped supporting my education since my father had to retire from work. I cannot ask them to get a load or anything like that since it would make their life even harder with a limited amount of money. I don't want to put any pressure over my family and parents. It would be a great help for not only me but also for my whole family to get the certificate of the course that will lead me to get a great job in the future.
