I want to take this course as I want to learn Deep Learning. I want to complete the course due to my curiosity and desire to be a data scientist. I can put the certificate on my resume to get a job as well as learning deep learning in-depth. This course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It will help perform better in carrying out various deep learning projects and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified proof will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course. I plan to complete all assignments on time or even before as I have done in previous Courses that I audited. Also, I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer-reviewed which I believe will a valuable learning opportunity.
